# Module 2 Challenge

This project was about starting a portfolio for potential employers to be able to see our work. 
The website needed to built using CSS and HTML, including pictures, links, contact information and an About Me section.

I was able to accomplish this by:
-Linking a past project to the HTML  -Creating borders, boxes and elements with CSS  -Properly linking contact info using HTML 

I learned how to start a project from scratch as this was my first project without any starter code. I felt much more
comfortable with the task as I went further along and my CSS abilities have grown considerably as a result.
